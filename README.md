# EDeCT : Electronics Design CLI Tools
FOSS CLI toolchain for assisting electronics design. Still in development. This is a page that lists all the tools in the toolchain.

## Contents
[twc](https://github.com/ymich9963/twc) - Trace Width Calculator, using IPC-2512 and IPC-2221. Calculate the trace widths for the required current in the trace. Also has some conversion functions to further assist design.

## Why
I started this project as practice to start coding something and expand my knowledge of C CLI tooling. I noticed there aren't any open source electronics related tools (except the KiCAD calculator), and I thought it might be cool to create some and allow other people to contribute. Benefit of open source is that everyone can see what happens under the hood therefore there's more confidence in workings of the tools.
